Bug – Council Room only draws 3 cards, not 4
Fault Location – fault is in function_renamed_council_room()
Test: random tester
	-failed case: numCardsInHand+4 == state.handCount[player]

Severity: Medium 
Priority: High
Reasoning for severity/priority: Every time the card is in the game it functions incorrectly, that fourth card could be that extra gold you need to get that providence.
