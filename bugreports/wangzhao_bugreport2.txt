Bug – Smithy only draws 2 cards, not 3
Fault Location – fault is in function_renamed_Smithy()
Test: unit test
	-failed case: numCardsInHand+3 == state.handCount[player]

Severity: Medium
Priority: High
Reasoning for Severity/Priority: Every time the card is in the game players get 2/3 of the functionality for the full cost of the card.
