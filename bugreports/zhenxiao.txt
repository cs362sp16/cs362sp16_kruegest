Bug – village only gives one action instead of two
Fault Location – fault is in fvillage()
Test: random test
	-failed case: playerActions+2 == state.numActions

Severity: Medium
Priority: High
Reason for severity/priority: Players dont get full effect every time its in the game. Not having that extra action makes village lose most of its benefit.
