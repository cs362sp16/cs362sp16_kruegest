This refactor took five cards out of the switch statement in the cardEffect function and gave them functions of their own. 
The five cards were, smithy, village, great hall, steward and council room. Smithy, council room, and village only required three parameters
current player, game state, and hand pos. The great hall and steward required extra parameters for the choices the player makes when playing the card.
The refactoring process itself was easy. The code inside the function is essentially the same as the code inside the switch statements, and all the functions
handle the discarding of the cards.
Each new function is marked with a comment.
