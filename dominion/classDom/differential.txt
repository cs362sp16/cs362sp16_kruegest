Results
-After comparing my dominion and Tanner Fry's I was able to find a difference with my
 first seed 42. Unfortunately Tanner's runs into a infinite loop so my diffdominion
 cannot generate proper output between the two. Since I have a pretty much fully fixed
 dominion and Tanner has done little to no work on his, I can conclud that their must be
 a bug in his with the cards that were played. Normally if we do not have a fixed dominion
 to compare it to this would be a challenge to see who has the right behavior and would
 require some debugging to figure it out (and both might be wrong to begin with).

-My random tester when run on my code with a seed of 100 gets 64% code coverage without
 needing a secondary run (which is pretty good). Tanner's however segfaults or runs into
 an infinite loop with every seed that I tested it with. Because of this I cannot properly
 get an accurate reading of code coverage for his dominion but by glancing at his code it
 should be slightly below mine (I have less executable lines in my dominion).
