Results
-After running all of the tests the results do not suprise me at all.
 Tests that I expected to pass passed and tests that I knew were going
 to fail failed (due to dominion.c being terrible and not implementing
 some card functionallity).

-I have spent a decent chunk of time fixing and refactoring dominion
 so I only tested functions that I have heavily modified and wanted
 to verify their correctness (which is why less assertions failed).
 I also moved some dominion_helper and card code into their own files
 which exaggerated the dominion code coverage and I'm pretty sure
 cardEffects coverage is more accurate of the entire code (~50%).

-I managed to achieve 100% statement coverage for all of the functions
 and cards that I tested which was one of my targets. I also tried
 feeding valid input, non-valid input, and some 1/1000 chance input to
 see how the code will react which was my final target. The tests are
 kind of long and I used some dominion_helper shortcuts to simplify it
 but doing so without it would have been insane and require much much
 more testing code to achieve the same effect.

-unittest4 was the only one that failed but that is because it tests
 endTurn which needs to handle outpost and gameOvers which was not in
 the original code and I have yet to implement that myself.
