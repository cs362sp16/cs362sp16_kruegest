I'm pretty awful when it comes to writing scripts and wasnt able to get diffdominion completely working. However
running diff by hand I was able to do some differential testing. Our code and our outputs are very differnt
and mine definitely didnt pass the test. Using differential testing isnt the best for this project
considering that neither testdominion is probably good enough to be considered an oracle.
