I'm much happier with the coverage I achieved this time around. Both the village and the smithy test achieved 100% coverage.
For adventurer I was able to achieve 90.91% coverage. To test how correct my tests were I made it so that both smithy and village
drew zero cards, and in this case both tests failed. Some of adventurer I failed to cover, as I couldn't get the drawntreausre variable
to work correctly in my test. 

Both the smithy and village took relatively little time to achieve 100% coverage, under 20 seconds for both.The coverage from 
these tests was much more comprehensive than those of the unit tests. But again, that is because my unit tests weren't very good.
I'm actually going to go back this weekend and update the unit tests as I believe I can do much better.
