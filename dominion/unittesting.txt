I'm honestly not sure if I've done everything right. After playing a couple games and running my tests 
the total coverage was only 18.76% percent, which is pretty weak. My unit tests aren't very comprehensive
either which could certianly explain why. My unit test for gardens fails, which is interesting as its a card
whose implementation looks fairly straighfoward in dominion.c. 

The unit test themselves were simple enough to write, getting the makefile to output all of them into one
file took the most research. I had a few problems with getting gcov to run on dominion.c. The error that was
returned was about mismatched "notes." It had something to do with one of the gcov files being created first. 
After I ran "make clean" and deleted the unittestresults.out file, it seemed to magically fix the problem.
